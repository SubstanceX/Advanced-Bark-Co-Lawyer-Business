                <p>A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.</p>

                <h2><center>Our Job</center></h2>
                <p> We as, lawyers, are the representers of defendants or prosecutors in the war of the adversial system. Our goal when on the defense, is to provide the evidence for the jury to determine that our client is innocent. As a prosecutor, we work to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. This scenario only takes place in criminal trials. In a civil trial, there is no jury, and the outcome of the case if brought about based on preponderance of evidence, so be prepared!</p>
